As part of my internship project, I developed a simple Expense Tracker App using Android. The main idea behind the app is to help users keep track of their daily expenses. In the app, users can add details like the amount spent, category (like Food, Transport, or Bills), date, and a note. I used Room, which is a database library built on top of SQLite, to store all the expense data locally on the device. This means the data stays even if the app is closed or the phone is restarted. The app also shows a list of all the expenses entered and allows the user to view them in order.

I built the app using Kotlin programming language in Android Studio. I followed the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to keep the code clean and easy to manage. The app has different parts like the data model (to store each expense), a DAO (to interact with the database), and a ViewModel (to connect the database with the user interface). Right now, when the user taps the “Add Expense” button, it adds a sample expense. The main screen shows all the expenses in a list. In future versions, I plan to improve the app by letting users manually enter their own expense details and view charts showing how they spend their money.

Working on this project helped me learn many important things about Android development, such as designing layouts, saving data locally, and handling user inputs. I also got experience using tools like Android Studio, Kotlin, Room, and Jetpack Compose. In the future, I would like to add more features like setting a monthly budget, adding charts to show spending summaries, and maybe even using cloud storage. Overall, this app gave me a solid understanding of how to build real mobile applications and showed me how all the parts of an app work together.
